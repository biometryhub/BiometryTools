\arguments{
\item{library}{The location of the library on the current machine to copy.}

\item{output}{One of \code{online} (the default), \code{gist} or \code{local}. Saves a list of installed packages to the chosen location, and provides instructions on how to use this to (re)install the packages elsewhere. See details for more information.}

\item{expiry}{Expiry for online file store in days. Weeks can be given with \code{w}, or months with \code{m}. Default is 7 days. Will be ignored if \code{output} is not \code{online}.}

\item{filename}{Filename for the local output file. Ignored if \code{output} is not set to \code{local}.}

\item{list_remotes}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}). Check for any packages installed from repositories other than CRAN, and output instructions to reinstall.}

\item{quiet}{Logical (default \code{FALSE}). Suppress output if \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Prints instructions to console if \code{quiet = FALSE}, and invisibly returns the source command to use on the other machine.

Easily reinstall all currently installed packages on another machine or version of R.

\details{
If \code{output} is \code{online}, the resulting list of currently installed packages is stored on \url{https://file.io} for the time specified in \code{expiry}, or until the URL is first accessed.
Note that both visiting the URL and sourcing the URL count as access, and it will be removed after either.
If \code{output} is \code{local}, an R script file (\code{.R}) is saved to the current working directory, which can be transferred manually to another machine.
Beware if using \code{quiet = TRUE} together with \code{output = online}, as the source command will not be
